## Nice to meet you

First of all, let me intrdouce myself : my name is **Hugo « Nekika » Jahnke** and as of writing this I'm a 21 years old web development student from **Nancy, France**.

While reading thoses lines you maybe have few questions so I'll try to answer them as much as I can !

## What is this blog about ?

**All and nothing**.

Jokes aside, this answer is pretty true in sense where I don't want to talk about a single subject. I would like to share things I like about **tech**, **culture** or **personal exeperiments** for example.

I'm concious that it's definitely not a revolutionnary idea and it can even be perceived as an old-school (or has-been ?)  way to share things in an age where you can take your iPhone, record yourself and post it on YouTube or Instagram.

## Then why do it anway ?

**Because I'm not expecting it to be read**.

Due to the current health crisis, I have a lot of free-time when my working-day is over. This blog is only a playground where I can pass time self-experimenting a lot of things about 3 main themes : 

### 1. Tech
I'm profiting this special situation to **discover/train** new technologies or **improve my skills** with some others that I like a lot.

This blog is a perfect example since it's mainly made using [strapi](https://strapi.io), that I'm currently discovering with big pleasure, and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) that I LOVE (the word is weak) so much.

I won't go further in details for the moment, but I'll maybe write a detailed post about the blog's development later !

### 2. Writing
This point can be divided in two parts :

On one hand, since I'm not a native speaker, I decided to **write in english** in order to **practice** and to **progress**. I only agreed to used tools like [linguee](https://linguee.fr) to find vocabulary or synonyms.

On the other hand, writing is not something I often do so it will compel me to **think about a subject** and find a good way to **talk about it**.

### 3. Personal experiment
By trying to hold a blog, I want to know if I'm able to **manage a project on duration**. 
It will help me to **know more about myself** and if there is some points that I should work on.


## Something else ?
I think that I've said everything about my **motivations around this blog** but if you still have any question, don't hesitate to **send me an email** (link below) and I'll be pleased to answer !

See you !
