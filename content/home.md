## Welcome

Noctambule is (at least for the moment) a minimalist blog where I'll share my enthousiasm around different subjects 
like tech, music or my own life experiments.

You can find more details about me, my motivations and the aim of this project by reading 
[this article](http://localhost:8080/posts/1).
