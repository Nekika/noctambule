## Why ?

Noctambule is a personal side-project that allows me to train myself with some new technologies.
Indeed, it's developed using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) (a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework) and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), that I've never used before.

Furthermore, beyond the technical aspect, It also teaches me soft skills that I would probalby not have acquired 
otherwise than by writing posts.

You can find more details about me, my motivations and the aim of this project by reading the
[first article](http://localhost:3000/posts/hello_world) of the blog.
