# Noctambule

Noctambule is a minimalist blog where I share my personal experience, and my enthusiasm about things I like.

## Stack

This project is mainly developed using [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) and it's recent [content plugin](https://github.com/nuxt/content) which, for this project, allows to fetch Markdown files through a MongoDB like API and access them from any Vue component.

Since it's a blog, it should be readable on every type of devices so  I wanted it to be nicely responsive. This is why I've chosen to try [tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) because its 100% customizable feature through a JS config file seduced me.
